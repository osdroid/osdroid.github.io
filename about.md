I will try to keep track of my programming adventures
with the Onyx Boox Note S. I'm quite convinced it's
a device full of potential. There are lots of features
I would love to see in it, many are very specific, so let's get working!

Guiding principles:
1. Every action should be started by me, no background syncing,
   no notifications. Wifi will remain off most of the time.  
2. Avoid partial UI refresh, treat everything as a "book", if
   possible avoid scrolling. Translate gestures done with the pen
   to commands. Instead of relying on the eraser, strikethrough!.  
3. Make it really easy to sync with my other devices. If I want to
   continue reading something from my phone/computer on the boox,
   then have the corresponding accompanying app/extension.

Some ideas I will try:  
* Use it as a monitor (I can easily clone part of my monitor, maybe
  even use something like xvfb to make it have its own).  
* Create my own email app, using Gmail and Outlook apis.  
* Make some games! Thinking about sudoku, and/or other pencil based.  
* Make my own browser, or simply a collection of web pages parsed/processed
  with [Readability](https://github.com/mozilla/readability).  
  Make a business app for filling up "surveys" and/or exams. :P
